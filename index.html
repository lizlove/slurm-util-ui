              <h3>What About Browser Support for Grid? What About IE11?! {{insert hipster slight or IE joke Here}}</h3>
              <p>
                You need to read Rachel Andrew's article over on
                <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/11/css-grid-supporting-browsers-without-grid/"
                  >Smashing Mag</a
                >. Even if you decide you can't use it today, I'd recommend still learning it as these older browsers
                will go away just as quick as grid showed up!

              <h3>What about Flexbox? Something you did can be done in 1 line less than Grid!</h3>
              <p>
                There is an entire video on CSS Grid vs Flexbox. In short, they both do their own thing, but there is
                also a large amount of overlap in functionality. Watch the video!

                While I'd absolutely love to help everyone out, there are 120,294 people taking this course and I can't
                handle that amount of email. If you are a member of one of my premium classes, you can jump into the
